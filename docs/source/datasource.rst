DataSource
##########

The DataSource class provides an efficient wrapper for the 
KeyFollower.Follower and KeyFollower.FrameGrabber classes. Instances of the
DataSource.DataFollower class are iterators with similar functionality to
instances of the KeyFollower.Follower class, however rather than indices they
simply produce the frames themselves.
