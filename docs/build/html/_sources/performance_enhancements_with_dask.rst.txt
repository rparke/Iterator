Boosting Performance with Dask
##############################


Dask is an open source library in python for parallel computing. It has a very
extensive feature set allowing projects built in standard scientific python
libraries to scale for very large datasets. In swmr_tools we currently only
use a small subset of dasks features to help parallelise operations on dataset
frames.
